  bio: "I am a passionate learner, open-source enthusiast, and Java developer with a drive for continuous improvement. 
  When I’m not coding, you can find me on the Brazilian Jiu Jitsu mats, playing the guitar, or exploring new challenges. 
  I believe in the power of community, collaboration, and creativity—both in and outside of tech."
